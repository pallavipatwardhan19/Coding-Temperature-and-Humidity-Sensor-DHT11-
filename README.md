In this project we interfaced Temperature and Humidity Sensor (DHT11) with Microcontroller 8051.   
The basic idea is to make use of 40 bit Digital Output of sensor DHT11 and control the speed of fan depending on the Temperature and Humidity of surrounding.  
The assembly language code for Interfacing of Microcontroller 8051 and DHT11 is attached in the code.asm file.
