**Project :**  
In this project we interfaced Temperature and Humidity Sensor (DHT11) with Microcontroller 8051.    
The basic idea is to make use of present values of temperature and humidity to control the speed of fan. 

**Strcuture :**  
The assembly language code for Interfacing of Microcontroller 8051 and DHT11 is attached in the code.asm file.  

**Testing :**  
This code was assembled using 'A51 Macro Assembler by Keil' and successfully run on Atmel 80C51.
